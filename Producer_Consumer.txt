When creating this project I first worked on establishing a shared memory space for the two processes.
This consisted of the inclusion of const character pointers that would be shared between the processes, 3 semaphores, a shared memory descriptor, and a table used for the shared memory
After the declaration of the variables I opened the shared memory space using shm_open and truncated the size.
I then mapped the table to the two processes and initialized the 3 semaphores.
The three semaphores that I used were a fill semaphore, available semaphore, and mutex binary semaphore.
